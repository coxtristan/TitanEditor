# About Me
My name is Tristan Cox and I have been writing software since middle school. I started Anomaly a few months ago shortly after my entry into the Black Ops 3 modding hobby. I enjoy developing software tools, especially if it involves taking something apart with a disassembler or a debugger to integrate the tool properly. I love C++, and would call it my "Home" language where I am most comfortable. I also enjoy talking about code or computers in general, and I recently have begun to love cloud computing and its possibilites. 

# About LunarAnomaly
"LunarAnomaly" is my portfolio and where I share my tools and knowledge. I have lots of ambitious plans for all my projects, and hope to be adding lots of them here for anybody to use. I really want to share the things I learn and create a "catalog" of my progress and the things I create. The name for the site is inspired by a popular creative writing project known as "SCP" and the programming language [Lua](http://www.lua.org/about.html) :crescent_moon:. 

# About Anomaly - GUI Design Tool

Anomaly is a tool for making Heads-Up-Displays (HUDS) for Call of Duty®: Black Ops 3. The tool is *unofficial*, meaning Anomaly is not in any way related to the actual development of any Call of Duty® title, and it is maintained only by me. 

### Anomaly is currently built with the following technologies/libraries: 
* [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/)
* [VueJS 2](https://vuejs.org/)
* [NuxtJS](https://nuxtjs.org/)
* [Nuxt Content plugin](https://content.nuxtjs.org/)
* [Konva.js](https://konvajs.org/)
* [AWS S3 Storage](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) 
* [AWS CloudFront CDN](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/)


Anomaly is currently in an Alpha state, as features are still being implemented. 

LunarAnomaly and Anomaly are "combined" and are my first experience building a full stack web application.
