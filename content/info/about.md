# About Me
My name is Tristan Cox and I have been writing software since middle school. I started Anomaly a few months ago shortly after my entry into the Black Ops 3 modding hobby. I have always enjoyed writing tools, especially if it involves taking something apart with a disassembler or a debugger to integrate the tool properly. I love C++, and would call it my "Home" language where I am most comfortable. I also enjoy talking about code or computers, and I recently have begun to love cloud computing and its possibilites. 

# About LunarAnomaly
"LunarAnomaly" is sort of my portfolio, where I show off my tools and knowledge. I have lots of ambitious plans for all my projects, and hope to be adding lots of them here for anybody to use. I also plan on writing short blogs/updates about my projects here as I really want to share the things I learn and document for future self my progress. The name for the site is inspired by a popular creative writing project known as "SCP" and the programming language LUA.

LunarAnomaly and Anomaly are "combined" and are my first experience building a full stack web application.
