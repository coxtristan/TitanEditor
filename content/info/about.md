# About Me :gorilla: :monkey:
My name is Tristan Cox and I have been writing software since middle school. I started Anomaly a few months ago shortly after my entry into the Black Ops 3 modding hobby. I enjoy developing software tools, especially if it involves taking something apart with a disassembler or a debugger to integrate the tool properly. I love C++, and would call it my "Home" language where I am most comfortable. I also enjoy talking about code or computers in general, and I recently have begun to love cloud computing and its possibilites.
